- SFEinkscape doesn't build with either gcc (because the dependent c++ libs
  are built with Sun Studio) or with Sun Studio (because it uses g++ specific
  code.  I'm working with the maintainers to fix the g++ specific code.
- SFEnvu builds, doesn't run
- SFEsourcenav needs more work, it duplicates things like wish8.3 in /usr/bin
- info dir updating needs to be fixed in several pkgs
- SFEgimmie panel applet is unstable, standalone gimmie exits with
  "RuntimeError: pygtk was not compiled with Numeric Python support"
