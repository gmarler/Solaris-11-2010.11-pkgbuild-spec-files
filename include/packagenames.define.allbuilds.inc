# place defines to match older packages here - this include file is the first of a series
# 

# there are very old build out there, we might not need
# to write special logic for builds older then build 81
# at least we should have logic for build 111 (or 101)
# and younger (there are lots of installs out there)

# normally packages are not too much fragmented into
# subpackages. (exception: openssl where we simply
# require all sub packages to keep things easy)

# in general:
#    pnm_buildrequires_packagenames     packagename-devel (on this special range of builds, -devel 
#                                                          if that exists, else just the package name)
#         pnm_requires_packagenames     packagename (on this special range of builds)

# note: the right hand side changes depending on the range of the build number where the include
# file is intended for. the left hand side always lists the package names in currently three
# variants: old SVR4 from SolarisExpress/early or OS2008/OS2009 the early OpenSolaris IPS based
# then the names on OpenSolaris IPS-base without the SUNW prefix and before the big renaming
# around build 133/134


# below this section will be overwritten by the include files for the later builds
# it is there so support build machines with osbuild < 133 or < 134
# but the spec file shave been written with package names presen on
# machines with newer osbuild / after the big package renaming bang

#note defines below will be overwritten with a new target package name
#because it got renamed by the two big renaming projects, 
#starting with build ??? and build 133/134 
#openssl is always a special case since sub packages got combined
#below: our target system is an IPS based OS2008/OS2009/OS2010
