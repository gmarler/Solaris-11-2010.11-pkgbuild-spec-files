spec-files-extra encumbered modules
===================================

The modules in this directory build source code that may be legally encumbered,
or have a dependency on modules that may have encumbrance.

Those who build, use, distribute, etc. code based on these spec files need to
ensure that laws are not violated by doing so.  Those who build modules based on
these spec files take full responsibility for ensuring that laws are properly
followed.  Those people who provide these spec files are providing them only
for those people who intend to use them with legal intent.

Intellectual property laws very from country to country.  It is recommended that
you consult a lawyer if you have any questions, to ensure that your idea of
"appropriate use" is valid, or to determine how laws affect you.

Please notify the maintainer of this module if you notice issues like:

- A module which has no encumbrance has been placed in this directory by
  accident.
- A module should be in this directory, but is not.
